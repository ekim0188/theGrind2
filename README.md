 -Uploaded cleanDBaccess2.py, cleanUnityTCPListener.py, loginScene-Scene1.unity, loggedIn-Scene2.unity, and saveCredentials-2.cs. 
 cleanDBaccess2.py queries the database to determine if login credentials are correct.
 cleanUnityTCPListener is a tcp socket to accept a connection from Unity, which sends a string of login credentials.
 loginScene-Scene1.unity takes username and password from user to be sent to the server and database for verification.
 loggedIn-Scene2.unity will be the beginning point for gameplay.
 saveCredentials-2.cs saves the users login information then opens a socket and sends the information to the server socket. The function to advance the scene based on credentials is embedded here.
